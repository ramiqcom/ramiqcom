Hi! It's me, Ramadhan!

I am a remote sensing data scientist who currently work at [Space4Good](https://space4good.com) in The Hague, Netherlands.
Originally from Indonesia where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Cartography :world_map: and Remote Sensing :artificial_satellite: from [Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://ugm.ac.id).

I like to explore data science :bar_chart: and web application :computer: for geospatial :compass: and earth observation :earth_asia:.
